# rl-snake

An attempt to build an AI that plays snake using a DQN. Inspired by DeepMind's [Atari paper](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf).

To run:
```
python main.py
```

This opens up a window where the environment is rendered. Press p to play/pause, d to debug, and any number n to fast-forward 10^n steps.
